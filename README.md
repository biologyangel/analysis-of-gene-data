# analysis-of-gene-data

## Project Description

This project is a beginner-level exercise in applying core Python programming concepts to simulate a basic biological data analysis task. Using a hardcoded list of hypothetical gene lengths, the Python script iterates through the data, applies conditional checks, calculates summary statistics, and extracts data points that meet specific criteria. It demonstrates foundational data processing steps relevant to working with genomic datasets.

## Features and Analysis Performed

-   Reads and iterates through a list of numerical data representing gene lengths.
-   Uses a for loop to process each gene length individually.
-   Applies an if statement to identify genes exceeding a specific length threshold (e.g., >1000 bp).
-   Calculates the total sum of all gene lengths in the dataset.
-   Counts the number of genes that meet the long criteria.
-   Collects and stores the actual values of the long gene lengths in a separate list.
-   Identifies and prints the index (position) within the original list where each long gene was found.
-   Formats output for readability using f-strings and blank lines.

## Key Concepts and Python Skills Practiced

This project provided hands-on practice with fundamental Python programming concepts, including:

-   Variables and Basic Operations
-   Lists (defining and working with a simple data structure)
-   for loops (iterating over sequences)
-   if statements (conditional logic)
-   enumerate() (looping with index access)
-   List methods (specifically .append() for adding items to a list)
-   Accumulating values (summing and counting) within a loop
-   F-strings for formatted output
-   Understanding and applying indentation for control flow blocks

## Learning Process and Development

This project was developed step-by-step as part of a Python Fundamentals learning bootcamp aimed at beginners in bioinformatics. It involved applying concepts immediately after learning them, including working through common challenges such as:

-   Distinguishing between processing the whole data list vs. individual items in a loop.
-   Correctly applying conditional logic (if) within a loop.
-   Managing variable scope and initialization (e.g., initializing sums/counts before a loop).
-   Using appropriate methods to collect conditional results (.append() to a list).
-   Accessing both item value and index during iteration (enumerate()).
-   Debugging code to achieve desired output formatting and logic.
